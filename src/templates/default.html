          <h2 id="primer">A primer of hex codes</h2><p>Hex, or hexidecimal codes, are a human-friendly representation of color corresponding to the amounts of red, green, and blue are used. Hex codes, as they’re often called, are always six digits long composed of both letters and numbers. But, not all letters show up in hex codes. Only A through F. Color values range from 00 (black) to FF (white).</p><p>Interestingly, the letters actually correspond with numbers themselves. We use numbers 0-9 when that applies to the value, and then letters for any numbers above 9 which would take up a second digit. A corresponds to 10, all the way to F which is 15.</p><p>I’m sure many of you are familiar with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/random-hex-color/" target="_blank" rel="ext">this code snippet from CSS Tricks</a>, showing us how to create a random hex code. It does work 90% of the time, but use it enough times and inevitably you will run into a bug which is that if the last character randomly becomes a 0 it gets lopped off. You could get even more unlucky and multiple characters randomly be 0 at the end of the string causing a too-short hex number. Sometimes they still work, but for our purposes today this inconsistency simply will not do.</p><p>So, instead we're going to create and use RGB codes directly. It's simple to convert a hexidemal code to RGB.
          Here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>Multiply the first number by 16</li><li>Multiply the second number by 1</li><li>Add the two totals together</li></ol><p>And repeat these steps for each set of two numbers. As you remember above, the red value corresponds to the first two characters, green second two characters, blue are the last two characters. These numbers would then correspond to RGB values.</p><p>RGB values are always displayed in a range from 0, none of that color, to 255, the maximum amount of a color. For instance, rgb(0,255,0) would have 0 red, maximum green, and 0 blue.</p><h2 id="game">Let's Play a Game</h2><p>Knowing this, let's take a look at this quick and dirty application which tasks the user to memorize and a color in a limited time frame. This application will generate a random color and then similar other random colors, more or less similar to the original random color depending on the level of difficulty selected. I'll describe how this game works below--but first, <b>check out the finished product.</b></p>

          <h2 id="generator">Generating similar colors</h2><p>This finally brings us back to our potential game. Our game should:</p><ol><li>Allow the user the choose a difficulty setting from easy to challenging</li><li>The game should score the user, if they got it wrong how wrong were they?</li><li>We should save those results to cookie if the user accepts cookies</li></ol><p>Sounds simple enough right, especially because we already know how to generate our random color. The first time I tried this out, I didn’t understand how hex codes were built and so I wrote logic that would randomize the number between 0 and 9, and use the next letter in the alphabet if the character was a letter up until F. When F was used, it would treat A as the next letter. Technically this did work, but depending on how many numbers were in the hex code the colors generated could be incredibly different--so different that the game wouldn’t be very fun. Where’s the challenge in remembering that the original color was purple in a sea of greens and reds?</p><p>Obviously, a revamp of the logic creating similar colors is in order. Thankfully, I now know how these codes are created and can manipulate the hex codes to our advantage.</p><p>I think the easiest way to achieve this effect would be to convert the hex code into RGB values, then select a random number with a variance that can be higher (making the numbers more different) or lower (making the numbers less different).</p><p>Let’s walk through this logic by starting with this color <b>#F5DF4D</b> (this is Pantone’s color of the year, a bright Yellow).</p><p>We would begin by converting this hex into an RGB. Remember that the letters simply correspond with a number after 9. F is the 6th letter in the alphabet, so 9 + 6 gets us our 15 number.</p><ul><li>Multiply 15 and 16, which equals 240</li><li>Multiply 5 and 1, which equals 5</li><li>Added together, we have an overall <b>Red</b> value of <b>245</b></li></ul><ul><li>Multiply 13 and 16, which equals 208</li><li>Multiply 15 and 1, which equals 15</li><li>Added together, we have an overall <b>Green</b> value of <b>223</b></li></ul><ul><li>Multiply 4 and 16, which equals 64</li><li>Multiply 13 and 1, which equals 13</li><li>Added together, we have an overall <b>Blue</b> value of <b>77</b></li></ul><p><b>RGB(245, 223, 77)</b></p><p>Now we will choose a fair range for each of these values. We’re looking for a little bit of a challenge but nothing crazy. This second pass will focus on the “easy” level, which would make the variance a little bit higher. Based on my tests in Photoshop, I think a range of +/- 20 in either direction would suffice here. We do need to be careful of a caveat that no RGB value can be over 255 or go below 0 so we will need to account for that.</p><p>For each separate number in the RGB…</p><p>Generate a random number +/- 40 (80 in both directions combined) from that number until it either reaches 255 or 0. Looking at 245, we can go up 10, so we will need to be able to go down 70 to equal 80 points up or down variance. Our range for the first number would be between <b>175 and 255</b></p><p>The range for the second number, 223, would be <b>175 and 255</b></p><p>The range for the third number, 77, would be <b>37 and 117</b></p><p>Finally, after all numbers have been generated we need to ensure we haven’t repeated any numbers in the array. If there is a repeated RGB value, we will recalculate until the array has 5 random, but similar, RGB colors.</p><p>At this point, it would also be good to calculate how similar each color is to the original color. I believe we could do that by calculating how far away the generated number is from the original number for each value and averaging those numbers.</p><p>For instance, let’s say we generated a random color <b>RGB(175, 175, 37)</b></p><ul><li>175 is <b>70</b> points below 245</li><li>175 is <b>48</b> points below 223</li><li>37 is <b>40</b> points below 77</li></ul><p>We average these scores to get an average variance of <b>52.66</b></p><p>Compare to a more similar <b>RGB(235,213,67)</b></p><ul><li>235 is <b>10</b> points below 245</li><li>213 is <b>10</b> points below 223</li><li>67 is <b>10</b> points below 77</li></ul><p>We average these scores to get an average variance of <b>10</b></p><p>If the user doesn’t guess the right color, but they do guess the color that is incredibly close we should capture that and encourage the user to keep trying and that they’re on the right track.</p><p>The user will be shown the first random color, our Pantone yellow here, for 10 seconds and after that will be shown a list of 6 colors. 5 of those colors will be random, generated above, and only 1 will be the correct one. They will select a color, and the script will determine if that color is the correct one. If it isn’t the correct color, it will look at the variance score of the selected color and rank their selection in order of best to worst.</p><p>Based on the variance score, we can tell how close the user got to getting the right answer and encourage them to try again. Afterwards, it might be good to show them all this information so they can see how the game works and improve.</p>
